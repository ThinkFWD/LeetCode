/* 
++++++ QUESTION ++++++ 

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

++++++ EXAMPLE ++++++
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

++++++ ANALYSIS ++++++

Assumption:
  Each input would only have 1 solution

Restriction:
  You cannot use the same element twice
